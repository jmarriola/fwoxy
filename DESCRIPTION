Title: Forward model of estuary dissolved oxygen time series 
Version: 0.1
Author: Arriola, J.M. & Herrmann, M.
Maintainer: Jill Arriola <jva5648@psu.edu>
Description: This model simulates estuarine net ecosystem metabolism based on data retrieved from the Apalachicola Bay,
    Florida, National Estuarine Research Reserve. The model allows for changing parameters of metabolism, such as wind
    speed, temperature, respiration, and water depth. This package includes source functions fun_density, fun_eqb_oxygen, 
    fun_gas_transfer_velocity, fun_par_sin_model, and fun_schmidt_oxygen.
